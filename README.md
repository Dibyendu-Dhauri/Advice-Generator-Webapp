# Advice_App
In this Project, I create an interesting react project from scratch - A React Advice App. We're going to use React on the front end and we'll make get requests to Advice Slip JSON API.
For API call I use Axios Library. For State Management I use useState Hook for fetching the data use useEffect Hook.
Project is Live on : https://helpful-souffle-c25a05.netlify.app/
